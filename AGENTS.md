# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Version Control

⚠️ **CRITICAL: This project uses Jujutsu (jj) for version control. NEVER use git commands directly. Use jj instead.**

### Committing Changes

When asked to commit or push changes, use these jj commands:

```bash
jj status            # Check working copy status (NOT git status)
jj diff              # View changes (NOT git diff)
jj describe -m "..." # Set commit message for current change
jj bookmark set main -r @  # Move main bookmark to current change
jj git push          # Push to remote
```

### jj vs git Quick Reference

| Don't use | Use instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| `git status` | `jj status` |
| `git diff` | `jj diff` |
| `git add` | (not needed - jj auto-tracks) |
| `git commit` | `jj describe -m "..."` |
| `git log` | `jj log` |
| `git push` | `jj git push` |
| `git branch` | `jj bookmark` |

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Authentication

- **Always** handle authentication flow at the router level with proper redirects
- **Always** be mindful of where to place routes. `phx.gen.auth` creates multiple router plugs and `live_session` scopes:
  - A plug `:fetch_current_scope_for_user` that is included in the default browser pipeline
  - A plug `:require_authenticated_user` that redirects to the log in page when the user is not authenticated
  - A `live_session :current_user` scope - for routes that need the current user but don't require authentication, similar to `:fetch_current_scope_for_user`
  - A `live_session :require_authenticated_user` scope - for routes that require authentication, similar to the plug with the same name
  - In both cases, a `@current_scope` is assigned to the Plug connection and LiveView socket
  - A plug `redirect_if_user_is_authenticated` that redirects to a default path in case the user is authenticated - useful for a registration page that should only be shown to unauthenticated users
- **Always let the user know in which router scopes, `live_session`, and pipeline you are placing the route, AND SAY WHY**
- `phx.gen.auth` assigns the `current_scope` assign - it **does not assign a `current_user` assign**
- Always pass the assign `current_scope` to context modules as first argument. When performing queries, use `current_scope.user` to filter the query results
- To derive/access `current_user` in templates, **always use the `@current_scope.user`**, never use **`@current_user`** in templates or LiveViews
- **Never** duplicate `live_session` names. A `live_session :current_user` can only be defined __once__ in the router, so all routes for the `live_session :current_user`  must be grouped in a single block
- Anytime you hit `current_scope` errors or the logged in session isn't displaying the right content, **always double check the router and ensure you are using the correct plug and `live_session` as described below**

### Routes that require authentication

LiveViews that require login should **always be placed inside the __existing__ `live_session :require_authenticated_user` block**:

    scope "/", AppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

      live_session :require_authenticated_user,
        on_mount: [{VibexWeb.UserAuth, :require_authenticated}] do
        # phx.gen.auth generated routes
        live "/users/settings", UserLive.Settings, :edit
        live "/users/settings/confirm-email/:token", UserLive.Settings, :confirm_email
        # our own routes that require logged in user
        live "/", MyLiveThatRequiresAuth, :index
      end
    end

Controller routes must be placed in a scope that sets the `:require_authenticated_user` plug:

    scope "/", AppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

      get "/", MyControllerThatRequiresAuth, :index
    end

### Routes that work with or without authentication

LiveViews that can work with or without authentication, **always use the __existing__ `:current_user` scope**, ie:

    scope "/", MyAppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser]

      live_session :current_user,
        on_mount: [{VibexWeb.UserAuth, :mount_current_scope}] do
        # our own routes that work with or without authentication
        live "/", PublicLive
      end
    end

Controllers automatically have the `current_scope` available if they use the `:browser` pipeline.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
bd ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
bd list --status=open # All open issues
bd show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
bd create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
bd update <id> --status=in_progress
bd close <id> --reason="Completed"
bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
bd sync               # Commit and push changes
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `bd ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `bd close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `bd sync` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `bd ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Best Practices

- Check `bd ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `bd create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `bd sync` before ending session
